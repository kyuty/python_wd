# The pass statement does nothing. 
# pass语句什么都不做。
# It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action.
# 当语法需要语句但程序不需要操作时，可以使用它。
>>> while True:
...     pass  # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
...

# This is commonly used for creating minimal classes
# 通常用于创建最小类
>>> class MyEmptyClass:
...     pass
...

# Another place pass can be used is as a place-holder for a function or conditional body when you are working on new code, allowing you to keep thinking at a more abstract level. The pass is silently ignored:
# 当您处理新代码时，可以使用另一个地方传递作为函数或条件体的占位符，允许您在更抽象的层次上继续思考。 pass被默默忽略：
>>> def initlog(*args):
...     pass   # Remember to implement this!
