# It is also possible to use a list as a queue,
# where the first element added is the first element retrieved (“first-in, first-out”);
# however, lists are not efficient for this purpose.
# While appends and pops from the end of list are fast,
# doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow
# (because all of the other elements have to be shifted by one).
# list也可以用来作为队列
# 作为“先进先出”的队列
# 然而，list并不是用于此目的的
# 虽然从list的末尾添加(append)或取出(pop)速度很快
# 但是从list的开头进行插入(insert)或取出(pop)速度很慢
# 因为所有的其他元素都必须移动一个位置
# collections.deque用法
# popleft函数
>>> from collections import deque
>>> queue = deque(["Eric", "John", "Michael"])
>>> queue.append("Terry")           # Terry arrives
>>> queue.append("Graham")          # Graham arrives
>>> queue
deque(['Eric', 'John', 'Michael', 'Terry', 'Graham'])
>>> queue.popleft()                 # The first to arrive now leaves
'Eric'
>>> queue.popleft()                 # The second to arrive now leaves
'John'
>>> queue                           # Remaining queue in order of arrival
deque(['Michael', 'Terry', 'Graham'])
